The purpose of this script `Micheal_Brewer_Hw2.py` is to replicate how an ATM accepts a user input of their pin and verifies that it meets the requirments of  1) being only numbers, 2) is 4 characters long, 3) macthes the rtequired pin.  

## Script usage
 
`Micheal_Brewer_Hw2.py` 

```python3
	$ python3 Micheal_Brewer_Hw2.py
	or
	./Micheal_Brewer_Hw2.py
```

## What each defenition does

- pin is set to userinput

- The `check()` def takes the argument of pin. It will test right off if the pin equals the hardcoded pin of 1234.
 
- The `length()` def takes the argument of pin. It checks to see if the pin is 4 characters long. If not it prints (" Invalid PIN lenth. Correct format is: <9876>").
 
- The `num()` def takes the argument of pin. It checks to see if pin is all numeric characters. If not it prints (" Invalid PIN character. Correct format is: <9876>").

- The `getInput()` def takes the argument pin. It runs a whie loop thatasks the user to input a pin and only allow 3 attempts to enter the correct pin. It calls defs `check()`, `length()`, and `num()` in the loop to check each of the user's inputs.
- attempts is set to 0 and increments to 3.

- The `main()` def calls the `getInput()` to start the process.
